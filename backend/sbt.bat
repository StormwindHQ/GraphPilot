[project/Kalimdor.js] Hey guys, I have developed an open-source Machine Learning library in Node.js (Typescript) recently.

The library focuses on simplicity for people like you and me. I thought more people using or interested Machine Learning results in the growth of the number of use-cases, which eventually helps general Machine Learning to evolve.

Please check out the repository and website, and share any thoughts with me. Please ￼⭐ the Github repository to support the project!
