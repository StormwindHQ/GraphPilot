# Stormwind

> Just like the city of Stormwind, it a hub of all people and robots.

Stormwind is a distributed and open source software that allows users to
easily create automated workflows of your daily computing tasks on the Internet with a few clicks.
Imagine building a complex operation that requires a multitude of programming skills
without actually coding anything, your life will be better.

We welcome contributions of all kinds.
We strive to automate the code review process with maximum effort
